</br>
Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</br>
</br>
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and</br>
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share</br>
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright</br>
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The</br>
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not</br>
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are</br>
&emsp;&ensp;intended for use by those authorized to give the public</br>
&emsp;&ensp;permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by</br>
&emsp;&ensp;copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are</br>
&emsp;&ensp;irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms</br>
&emsp;&ensp;and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before</br>
&emsp;&ensp;applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any</br>
&emsp;&ensp;material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-</br>
&emsp;&ensp;licensed material, or material used under an exception or</br>
&emsp;&ensp;limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:</br>
&emsp;wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</br>
</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Considerations for the public: By using one of our public</br>
&emsp;&ensp;licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If</br>
&emsp;&ensp;the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for</br>
&emsp;&ensp;example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to</br>
&emsp;&ensp;copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our</br>
&emsp;&ensp;licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain</br>
&emsp;&ensp;other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of</br>
&emsp;&ensp;the licensed material may still be restricted for other</br>
&emsp;&ensp;reasons, including because others have copyright or other</br>
&emsp;&ensp;rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;such as asking that all changes be marked or described.</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to</br>
&emsp;&ensp;respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations</br>

&emsp;&ensp;dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material</br>
&emsp;&ensp;available to the public including in ways that members of the</br>

</br>
&ensp;a. License grant.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in part; and</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;its terms and conditions.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;6(a).</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;authority to forbid You from making technical modifications</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;(4) never produces Adapted Material.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;5. Downstream recipients.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;recipient of the Licensed Material automatically</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Public License.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Every recipient of Adapted Material from You</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;any additional or different terms or conditions on, or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Material.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. Other rights.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Rights, but not otherwise.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Public License.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;reserves any right to collect such royalties.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 3 -- License Conditions.</br>
</br>
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the</br>
following conditions.</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. Attribution.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;form), You must:</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with the Licensed Material:</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Material and any others designated to receive</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the Licensor (including by pseudonym if</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;designated);</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ii. a copyright notice;</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;warranties;</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;extent reasonably practicable;</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;retain an indication of any previous modifications; and</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hyperlink to, this Public License.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;hyperlink to a resource that includes the required</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;information.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;reasonably practicable.</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. ShareAlike.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&ensp;In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;license with the same License Elements, this version or</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;context in which You Share Adapted Material.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</br>
</br>
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that</br>
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right</br>
&emsp;&ensp;to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial</br>
&emsp;&ensp;portion of the contents of the database;</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database</br>
&emsp;&ensp;contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;including for purposes of Section 3(b); and</br>
</br>
&ensp;c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share</br>
&emsp;&ensp;all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</br>
</br>
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not</br>
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed</br>
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE</br>
&emsp;&ensp;EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS</br>
&emsp;&ensp;AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF</br>
&emsp;&ensp;ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</br>
&emsp;&ensp;PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT</br>
&emsp;&ensp;KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT</br>
&emsp;&ensp;ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE</br>
&emsp;&ensp;TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,</br>
&emsp;&ensp;COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR</br>
&emsp;&ensp;USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN</br>
&emsp;&ensp;ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR</br>
&emsp;&ensp;DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR</br>
&emsp;&ensp;IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</br>
</br>
&ensp;c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided</br>
&emsp;&ensp;above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent</br>
&emsp;&ensp;possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and</br>
&emsp;&ensp;waiver of all liability.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with</br>
&emsp;&ensp;this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License</br>
&emsp;&ensp;terminate automatically.</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Section 6(a), it reinstates:</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;violation; or</br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</br>
</br>
&emsp;&ensp;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any</br>
&emsp;&ensp;right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations</br>
&emsp;&ensp;of this Public License.</br>
</br>
&ensp;c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop</br>
&emsp;&ensp;distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so</br>
&emsp;&ensp;will not terminate this Public License.</br>
</br>
&ensp;d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public</br>
&emsp;&ensp;License.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different</br>
&emsp;&ensp;terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and</br>
&emsp;&ensp;independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</br>
</br>
</br>
Section 8 -- Interpretation.</br>
</br>
&ensp;a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and</br>
&emsp;&ensp;shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose</br>
&emsp;&ensp;conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully</br>
&emsp;&ensp;be made without permission under this Public License.</br>
</br>
&ensp;b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is</br>
&emsp;&ensp;deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision</br>
&emsp;&ensp;cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License</br>
&emsp;&ensp;without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and</br>
&emsp;&ensp;conditions.</br>
</br>
&ensp;c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no</br>
&emsp;&ensp;failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the</br>
&emsp;&ensp;Licensor.</br>
</br>
&ensp;d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted</br>
&emsp;&ensp;as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities</br>
&emsp;&ensp;that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal</br>
&emsp;&ensp;processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</br>
